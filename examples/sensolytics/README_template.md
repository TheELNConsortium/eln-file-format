## Information
Sensolytics GmbH is developing and producing instruments for electrochemical research, focused on localised electrochemistry. Our Scanning Droplet Cell Systems are used to run user-defined electroanalytical experiments at defined positions of a sample surface, and can produce large numbers of datafiles (binary, undisclosed format of a third-party), depending on the users experimental settings. To provide users an easy way of loading the measured data into their electronic labbook, we added an export function which is saving a .eln file including the raw data and the scan parameters (*i.e. the grid definition*).
